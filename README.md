<h1>30 Days of CSS</h1>
<h3>A 30-day challenge from FrontLoops.io to practice my CSS skills.</h3>
<p>I initially started this 30 days of CSS on October 1, which was quite ambitious of me considering I left for vacation on October 3!</p>
<p>Day 1 is from October 1, and Day 2 is from October 2. Day 3 picks up on October 12th. I'll be adding each challenge daily for the next 27 days.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Day 4 update:</strong> This was an interesting challenge, building a messenger box. I realized that the developers of these challenges use different states (active, hover, etc.) often, as well as the position tag. I haven't fully learned about these yet, so it seems like I have some homework to do.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Day 5 update:</strong> This challenge was pretty straightforward; it only took me about an hour to do, which is impressive for me at this point in my dev learning. I had some issue with the QR code, deciding to make it a background or using the image tag. I decided to go with the background, since I see this more commonly in other devs' work.</p>
<br>
<p>Quick side note - I'm also practicing my responsive coding skills with these challenges, so they'll have slightly different versions from mobile to tablet to desktop.</p>
