<h1>30 Days of CSS</h1>
<h3>A 30-day challenge from FrontLoops.io to practice my CSS skills.</h3>
<p>I initially started this 30 days of CSS on October 1, which was quite ambitious of me considering I left for vacation on October 3!</p>
<p>Day 1 is from October 1, and Day 2 is from October 2. Day 3 picks up on October 12th. I'll be adding each challenge daily for the next 27 days.</p>
