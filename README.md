<h1>30 Days of CSS</h1>
<h3>A 30-day challenge from FrontLoops.io to practice my CSS skills.</h3>
<p>I initially started this 30 days of CSS on October 1, which was quite ambitious of me considering I left for vacation on October 3!</p>
<p>Day 1 is from October 1, and Day 2 is from October 2. Day 3 picks up on October 12th. I'll be adding each challenge daily for the next 27 days.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Day 4 update:</strong> This was an interesting challenge, building a messenger box. I realized that the developers of these challenges use different states (active, hover, etc.) often, as well as the position tag. I haven't fully learned about these yet, so it seems like I have some homework to do.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Day 5 update:</strong> This challenge was pretty straightforward; it only took me about an hour to do, which is impressive for me at this point in my dev learning. I had some issue with the QR code, deciding to make it a background or using the image tag. I decided to go with the background, since I see this more commonly in other devs' work.</p>
<br>
<p>Quick side note - I'm also practicing my responsive coding skills with these challenges, so they'll have slightly different versions from mobile to tablet to desktop.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Day 6 update:</strong> Just when I thought I was doing great at code, I get humbled a bit :) I had a hard time with this one; it felt like there were so many divs within divs, making it hard to track the padding and margin sizes on each element. I didn't get the exact design they showed, but close!</p>
<p><strong>Day 7 update:</strong> Aaaand I'm feeling back up with this challenge; it was quite simple. Sometimes when I compare my code to the source code, it seems like the developers are making it more difficult than it should be. For example, the small orange line under the header--I used the hr html tag and then formatted it with CSS, whereas they chose to use the ::before state on the div.</p>
<br>
<p>Another quick update - I realized that Frontloops.io is giving me different stages, aka loops. With Loop 1, everything has fixed sizes, so I decided to revert back to that styling for now. I'm hoping when Loop 2 starts with Day 11, I'll be focused on responsiveness.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Day 8 update:</strong> I'm starting to get a better hang of the box model and how to translate that into HTML and corresponding CSS. One thing I need to learn more about are SVGs--the developers of this challenge like to use them, and they regularly give me minor headaches. All in all, I'm feeling a lot more confident with my CSS skills so far!</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Day 9 update:</strong> I'm a day late on this one; it took me a little longer than expected with the varying divs. I had some trouble selecting certain text, which I'm going to look into so I understand why I wasn't able to change some of the headers and paragraphs. Overall I liked this day's challenge--even if it was especially challenging--because it made me think harder than normal on the layout.</p>
